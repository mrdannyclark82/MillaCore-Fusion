# Homomorphic Encryption Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to integrate production-grade homomorphic encryption (HE) into the Milla-Rayne system.

## Current State
- **Location**: `server/crypto/homomorphicPrototype.ts`
- **Implementation**: Prototype using AES-256-CBC with HE markers
- **Purpose**: Encrypt sensitive PII fields in memory storage
- **Usage**: Called by `memoryService.ts` for sensitive context data

## Recommended Solution: node-seal (Microsoft SEAL for Node.js)

### Why node-seal?
1. **Production-Ready**: Based on Microsoft SEAL, a mature C++ HE library
2. **Node.js Native**: npm package with TypeScript support
3. **BFV/CKKS Schemes**: Supports both integer and approximate arithmetic
4. **Active Maintenance**: Regularly updated and well-documented
5. **Performance**: Native bindings provide good performance
6. **License**: MIT (compatible with our project)

### Alternative Considerations

#### Why NOT browser-based HE libraries?
- **tfhe.js**: Too heavy for server-side, designed for browser
- **concrete-js**: Still experimental, limited Node.js support
- **paillier-bigint**: Only supports additive operations (too limited)

#### Why NOT full C++ libraries directly?
- **Microsoft SEAL**: Would require C++ bindings
- **HElib**: Complex build process, no official Node.js bindings
- **PALISADE**: Deprecated in favor of OpenFHE

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Install and Setup (Minimal Changes)
```bash
npm install node-seal
```

#### Phase 2: Replace Prototype Functions
Replace the following in `homomorphicPrototype.ts`:
- `encryptHomomorphic()` → Use SEAL BFV encryption
- `decryptHomomorphic()` → Use SEAL BFV decryption  
- `queryHomomorphic()` → Implement encrypted search using SEAL operations
- `computeOnEncrypted()` → Use SEAL evaluator for operations

#### Phase 3: Key Management
- Generate and store encryption keys securely
- Implement key rotation mechanism
- Add key derivation for different data domains

#### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Update existing tests in `__tests__/homomorphicEncryption.test.ts`
- Add performance benchmarks
- Validate encryption/decryption correctness

## Deployment Considerations

### Browser/Edge Compatibility
**Challenge**: The problem statement mentions "browser/edge-compatible"

**Solution Options**:
1. **Server-Side Only** (Recommended): Keep HE on server, send only encrypted data to clients
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Use lightweight encryption (FPE) for client-side, full HE server-side
3. **WebAssembly**: Compile SEAL to WASM (complex, may impact performance)

**Recommendation**: Server-side only. Benefits:
- Better performance (native code)
- Easier key management
- No WASM complexity
- Clients never see sensitive data unencrypted

### Performance Impact
- **Encryption**: ~10-50ms per field (acceptable for memory storage)
- **Decryption**: ~10-50ms per field
- **Search**: ~100-500ms per query (acceptable for infrequent searches)
- **Memory**: ~10-50KB per encrypted field (manageable)

### Fallback Strategy
If node-seal proves too complex or has performance issues:
1. **Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE)**: Use `ff1` package for maintaining data format
2. **Searchable Encryption**: Use `searchable-symmetric-encryption` for encrypted search
3. **Hybrid**: FPE for format-critical fields, traditional AES for others

## Implementation Timeline
1. ✅ Research and planning (this document)
2. ⏳ Install node-seal and create wrapper layer
3. ⏳ Implement basic encrypt/decrypt with SEAL
4. ⏳ Implement encrypted search functionality
5. ⏳ Update memoryService.ts integration
6. ⏳ Add comprehensive tests
7. ⏳ Performance benchmarking
8. ⏳ Documentation and deployment guide

## Security Considerations
1. **Key Storage**: Use environment variables initially, migrate to KMS/HSM for production
2. **Key Rotation**: Implement quarterly rotation policy
3. **Access Control**: Log all encryption/decryption operations
4. **Audit Trail**: Track which services access sensitive encrypted data
5. **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/HIPAA compliance for PII handling

## Minimal Change Principle
To maintain minimal changes:
1. Keep existing function signatures in `homomorphicPrototype.ts`
2. Replace only the internal implementation
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing encrypted data
4. Add migration script for re-encrypting old data
5. No changes to `memoryService.ts` API

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test encryption/decryption correctness
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with memoryService.ts
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against prototype
4. **Migration Tests**: Verify old data can be re-encrypted
5. **Security Tests**: Validate key management and access control
