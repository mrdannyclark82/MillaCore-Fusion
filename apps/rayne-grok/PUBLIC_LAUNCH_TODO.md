# TODO Before Making Repository Public

This is your actionable checklist for preparing the repository for public release. Complete these items in order.

## 🚨 CRITICAL - DO THESE FIRST (Security)

### 1. Rotate ALL Exposed API Keys ⚠️ MANDATORY

The following API keys were found in committed files and MUST be rotated:

- [ ] **xAI API Key** - Get new at https://console.x.ai/
- [ ] **OpenRouter Mistral Key** - Rotate at https://openrouter.ai/
- [ ] **OpenRouter Venice Key** - Rotate at https://openrouter.ai/
- [ ] **OpenRouter Qwen Key** - Rotate at https://openrouter.ai/
- [ ] **OpenRouter Gemini Key** - Rotate at https://openrouter.ai/
- [ ] **OpenRouter Grok Key** - Rotate at https://openrouter.ai/
- [ ] **Wolfram Alpha App ID** - Rotate at https://developer.wolframalpha.com/
- [ ] **GitHub Token** - Revoke and create new at https://github.com/settings/tokens
- [ ] **ElevenLabs API Key** - Rotate at https://elevenlabs.io/
- [ ] **Google OAuth Client ID & Secret** - Create new at https://console.cloud.google.com/
- [ ] **Google API Key** - Rotate at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- [ ] **Hugging Face API Key** - Rotate at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- [ ] **Admin Token** - Generate new: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] **Memory Encryption Key** - Generate new: `openssl rand -base64 32`

**After rotating, update your local `.env` file with the new keys.**

### 2. Verify Sensitive Data Removal

- [x] ~~Removed .env.save and .env.save.1 files~~ (DONE)
- [x] ~~Removed personal conversation data~~ (DONE)
- [x] ~~Removed audio messages~~ (DONE)
- [x] ~~Updated .gitignore~~ (DONE)
- [ ] Double-check no other sensitive files exist: `git grep -i "password\|secret\|token" -- '*.ts' '*.js'`

### 3. Clean Git History (Optional but Recommended)

Since sensitive data was in the repository:

- [ ] **Option A**: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive data from history
  ```bash
  # Install BFG
  brew install bfg  # or download from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
  
  # Clone a fresh copy
  git clone --mirror https://github.com/mrdannyclark82/Milla-Rayne.git
  
  # Remove sensitive files
  bfg --delete-files .env.save* Milla-Rayne.git
  bfg --delete-files memories.txt Milla-Rayne.git
  
  # Clean and force push
  cd Milla-Rayne.git
  git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
  git push --force
  ```

- [ ] **Option B**: Start fresh with a new repository
  - Create new empty repository
  - Copy current cleaned state
  - Push as initial commit
  - Archive old repository

## 📋 HIGH PRIORITY - Do Before Public Launch

### 4. Branch Cleanup

If you're unsure about any step:
1. Review the detailed guide documents above
2. Check GitHub's documentation
3. Ask in developer communities (Stack Overflow, Reddit)
