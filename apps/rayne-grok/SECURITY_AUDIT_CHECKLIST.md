# Security Audit Checklist - Before Making Repository Public

## ⚠️ CRITICAL - API Keys and Secrets

**Status: URGENT - API keys were found committed in .env.save files**

   - Action: Rotate key at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

9. **Admin Token**
   - Old Token: `9bd3f016f6e081a399a7161816cfcd8eab50dafb87793e9fa897960e7add40e7`

10. **Memory Encryption Key**
    - Old Key: `jNk/Cbxt1iMuCauyx70EXG2hZ5VLtCmt4E3XhnrnF+o=`
    - Action: Generate new key: `openssl rand -base64 32`
    - Note: This will require re-encrypting existing encrypted memories

## 🔒 Personal Data Removed

- [x] **REMOVED**: Personal conversation history (`memory/memories.txt` - 11MB+)
- [x] **REMOVED**: Encrypted memories (`memory/memories_encrypted.txt`)
- [x] **REMOVED**: Merged memories (`memory/merged_memories.txt`)
- [x] **REMOVED**: Audio messages (11 .webm files from `memory/audio_messages/`)
- [x] **REMOVED**: CSV backups (`memory/Milla_backup.csv`, `memory/knowledge.csv`)
- [x] **REMOVED**: Log files that might contain personal data

## 📝 .gitignore Updated

- [x] Added patterns to prevent committing `.env.save*` files
- [x] Added patterns for all memory files with personal data
- [x] Added patterns for log files and debug output
- [x] Added virtual environment directories (.venv, python/)
- [x] Added local config directories (.local, .config, .idx)

## 🧹 Repository Cleanup Completed

- [x] Removed 1700+ tracked files from virtual environments
- [x] Removed debug logs and server logs
- [x] Removed personal audio recordings

## 📋 Additional Security Best Practices

### Before Going Public:

1. **Review All Files**
   - [ ] Search for hardcoded credentials: `git grep -i "password\|api_key\|secret\|token" -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.js' '*.py'`
   - [ ] Check for personal names or identifiable information
   - [ ] Review comments for sensitive information

2. **Update Documentation**
   - [ ] Ensure README doesn't reference personal information
   - [ ] Update setup instructions to use `.env.example` only
   - [ ] Add security best practices to SECURITY.md

3. **Git History Considerations**
   - [ ] Consider using BFG Repo-Cleaner or git-filter-repo to remove sensitive data from history
   - [ ] Note: Since API keys were exposed, rotating them is MANDATORY regardless of history cleanup

4. **Enable GitHub Security Features**
   - [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts
   - [ ] Enable secret scanning
   - [ ] Enable code scanning (if applicable)
   - [ ] Add branch protection rules

5. **Review Access Controls**
   - [ ] Set up appropriate collaborator permissions
   - [ ] Consider using GitHub Environments for deployment secrets
   - [ ] Enable 2FA for all maintainers

## 🎯 Post-Publication Monitoring

After making the repository public:

- [ ] Monitor GitHub security alerts
- [ ] Set up notifications for new issues/PRs
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Review any contributions for security issues

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **The exposed API keys have access to paid services**. Rotating them is not optional.
2. **Personal conversations were in plain text**. Consider who might have accessed the repository before this cleanup.
3. **Git history still contains the sensitive data**. Consider force-pushing a cleaned history or starting fresh if this is a concern.
4. **Memory encryption key exposure** means any encrypted memories could be decrypted by anyone with repository access.

## 📞 Emergency Response

If you discover unauthorized usage of the exposed keys:

1. Immediately rotate the affected key
2. Check service usage logs for unauthorized access
3. Contact the service provider if suspicious activity is detected
4. Consider filing a security incident report with affected services
